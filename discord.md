# ðŸ‘¾ on Discord

Discord intro documentation: [here](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360045138571-Beginner-s-Guide-to-Discord)

Our asynchronous platform for building our studio community - the online component.

## to start our Discord server:
  - make a [text channel](https://discord.com/blog/starting-your-first-discord-server) for your project in the "Project Updates" category on the left, by clicking the "+" to "Create Channel"
  - you can name the channel after yourself, or the title of the project you're working on
  - post a "hello world" message in that channel

Every week you are responsible for:
  - posting @ least 1 update
  - asking @ least 1 question
  - responding to @ least 1 post by someone else

**DUE: 5:00pm EST, Monday *each* week; first update/question/response due Sept. 12th**

These are truly minimums - my hope is that the Discord will be a space where you can ask any programming or project question you have, post something helpful that you found on Stack Overflow or a tutorial you liked, get inspired by other students' work and questions, etc. You are expected to be active every week, throughout the week - **I highly encourage you to document your process as you go here**, rather than uploading your updates right before our Monday classes. The Discord is not for the professor to check up on you; it's a running archive of our documentation (which will be much easier to write up if you have a record!), and a space for all of us to collaboratively build these projects and help each other out.

I will be an active member of the Discord as well, answering questions where it's helpful and connecting you to someone else in the class where it's possible. This is also where I will get a sense of what kind of workshops would be most helpful to everyone: for example, if everyone is having a similar Python issue, or big questions about user testing, or an interest in new AI developments, my next workshop could address these topics. **Part of my role will be looking for themes that are surfacing across everyone's different projects.** There may also be chances to vote on upcoming topics of interest.

You will all have the ability to create new channels - please do so! For fun or serious purposes.

Current "starter" channels:
  - community code (TBD)
  - general
  - questions
  - resources
  - debug
  - announcements
  - notes
  - 1:1 meeting schedules
  - opportunities

Remember that a condition of being a member of the Discord, and therefore being a member of this class, will be agreeing to the Community Code that we write.

Other ideas:
  - a job post channel, opportunities, questions about life and "next year"
  - virtual guest speakers, available for "AMA" type responses for 1 week
