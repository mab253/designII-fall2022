# ðŸ‘¾ on Discord

Discord intro documentation: [here](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360045138571-Beginner-s-Guide-to-Discord)

Our asynchronous platform for building our studio community. 

Everyone will have their own channel, for their own updates and documentation. You can name this after your project, or give it your own name.

Every week you are responsible for:
  - posting @ least 2 updates
  - asking @ least 1 question

These are truly minimums - my hope is that the Discord will be a space where you can ask any programming question you have, post something helpful that you found on Stack Overflow or another fun forum, get inspired by other students' work and questions, etc.
