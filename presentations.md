# üì£ workshop project presentations

Throughout the semester, each project will give 2 workshop presentations. These presentations will be approx. 6 weeks apart, so you will present at different points in your project's development. The presentation topics and format are open-ended: you may choose whatever you want to share or however you think your project will best be served by class feedback. Some examples of what you might present:

- give us context and ask us a big decision point about your project
- talk us through a debugging story or a problem you solved
- show us a version of a prototype
- show us somewhere you are stuck
- teach us a tutorial of something new you learned
- show us your program's logic flow or database design
- show us some of your ideas for visual design
- connect your project to a socio-technical issue and tell us a story

While much of this is open and flexible, there are a few requirements:

- please include some form of visual aid: digital slides, screenshots of your work, paper prototype, etc.
- significant live whiteboard (chalkboard, in our case) work can replace visual aid
- **TIMING IS IMPORTANT:** see below.

# ‚è∞ on timing

You will have 30 minutes to present - the class time is yours! However:

- approx. **15-20 minutes** of material is ideal; you will need to give time for the class to participate and give you feedback
- you **cannot** go over 30 minutes in class. There will be a timekeeper who will unfortunately need to cut you off.
- you **cannot present < 10 minutes** of material - this will not be a sufficient shareback and not enough material for the class to give helpful critique.

**I highly encourage you to practice and time your talk** before you present it in class. These presentations do not have to be super formal or polished, but the timing does matter - when you practice, make sure that you plan to talk for more than 10 minutes and less than 30 minutes!

## presentation schedule: (as set on 08.29.22)

Project 1: AS, Relation Extraction, Week 3 + Week 9

## grading

Each presentation is 10% of your final grade. Your workshop presentation will be evaluated on timing (enough material and not going too long over 30 minutes), engagement of the class and space for critique, and the preparation of your content.


NOTE: 
There are good examples of short talks on the [!!Con](https://bangbangcon.com/2021/) website archive, as well as many other conferences (Mozilla Fest, etc.) throughout the web.
