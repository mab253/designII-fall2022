## ðŸ˜ºðŸ¤– github: comment assignment

Using the code that you updated to your own branches from your first prototype, I will be making a few comments and asking questions via Github. This is a good opportunity to learn about the collaborative infrastructure that programmers sometimes use on Github - we will be making use of [pull requests](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests), reviews, and comments.

1. I will alert you on Discord when I've started a review and commented on your code - you may also get an e-mail notification on Github, depending on your settings.  
2. I will comment on your code by creating a **pull request** - if this were a traditional repository where we were all working on the same project, this would mean I am requesting that you take a look at my comments before making any changes to your branch (or, the `main` branch). You can see a list of "Pull Requests" by clicking on the menu item in the main repository page:

3. Find the pull request in the list that refers to your project, and click it to open. You should see line-numbered code along with my comments, like in the example screenshot here:

4. Respond to the comments/questions using the text boxes provided, where it says "Reply...". You could also click the "View changes" link or the "Files changed" button in order to see your full code with more context, including the comments. Make sure to remember to click the green "Comment" button to save your contribution!
5. For now, please ignore the information at the bottom of this page. In some projects, you would possibly be able to "merge" the branches and "resolve" the pull request - but for this assignment, we just want to work with comments, **we don't want to make any changes to any branches** (especially `main`!). This is why the bottom of this screen shows that merging is blocked, in red - I "protected" the branch from changes as an admin:

Please feel free to post any questions about this process on Discord this week - we can support each other if Github is new to you!
