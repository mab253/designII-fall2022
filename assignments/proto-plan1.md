## ðŸ¤– prototype plan #1

**due: Sept. 29th, by the end of Studio Time in class (9pm)**

For this prototype plan, you will determine the scope, fidelity, and general blueprint for your first prototype. The first prototype itself is due October 17th, in-class. 

Knowing where you are with your project currently, **what can you commit to building in approximately 4 more weeks?** 

Your prototype plan needs to be at least 500 words, and should answer the following:

- What do you plan to share in-class on October 17?
- What tools will you use to make this prototype? 
  - Please be very specific here. For example: "I will create a clickable HTML and CSS prototype for the front-end of my app, coding from scratch in a text editor." Or "I will share a rough draft of my Python program that currently works in the command line only, and only gives text outputs." Or "I will use Landbot the no-code editor to create an end-to-end testable prototype."
- What are 2 "user testing" questions, that you want to ask someone using this prototype for feedback?
- How will this prototype help you with the next phase of your build?
- What is _not_ included in this version of your prototype? 
- Please include 1 diagram to illustrate your prototype plan: this could be a systems diagram showing where your prototype fits into the larger project, or a sketch of what the prototype will actually look like, or a logic flow for the prototype, etc.

Please create a file for this plan, and upload the file via your project's Discord channel.

*For projects with multiple collaborators: you may turn in 1 prototype plan, but please add a paragraph that addresses your current division of labor.*

I will give feedback on prototype plans that are turned in **on-time**, by Oct. 3rd. As always, I will answer any questions that I can via the Discord as well.
