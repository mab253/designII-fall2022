## ðŸ‘» prototype plan #2

**due: Oct. 31st, by the end of Studio Time in class (9pm)** ðŸŽƒ

For this prototype plan, you will determine the scope, fidelity, and general blueprint for your second, final prototype. The final prototype itself is due in demo form in-class on Dec. 12th, with a final package of code and documentation due on Dec. 16th.

Knowing where you are with your project currently, **what can you commit to building in approximately 6 more weeks?**

This written prototype plan is very important - it outlines what we can expect from your final project. Have you run into issues that you didn't expect at the beginning of the semester? That's OK - and a very typical part of the engineering process! This plan allows you to communicate your current limitations, and your reasoning for choosing which features to finish and at what level realistically in 6 weeks.

As a general guideline, the final prototype for these projects should:

- involve dynamic data passed between a front-end input and a back-end; this final prototype should not be a static-only design
- involve at least some front-end design work
- allow someone to run your code, either online or by following instructions to run a package locally

Your plan needs to be at least 500 words, and should answer the following:

- What do you plan to have completed by Dec. 12th?
- What features will be functional in this version of your prototype? Please carefully list every feature; a bullet-pointed list is great.
- What is _not_ included in this version of your prototype? What are some features that you thought you would build this semester, that you may be choosing to cut and leave for future extensions of this project? Why?
- What else has changed in your plan from the beginning of the semester, to plan #1, to now? If you want to include a diagram to help illustrate this, you may.
- Please include **2 images** (this could be hand-drawn or a mockup) of what your prototype front-end will look like. These are not supposed to be final images, but more to give an idea of what to expect for your final (for example: there will be a landing page with a text box; there will be a results page with a sidebar, etc.). You do not need to show every possible screen.

Please create a file (.PDF, .DOCX, etc.) for this plan, and upload the file via your project's Discord channel by 9pm on Oct. 31st.

*For projects with multiple collaborators: you may turn in 1 prototype plan, but please add a paragraph that addresses your current division of labor.*

I will give feedback on prototype plans that are turned in **on-time**, by Nov. 7th. This feedback will be important for your 2nd prototype - we need to make sure we are on the same page about the scope for your final project. As always, I will answer any questions that I can via the Discord as well.
