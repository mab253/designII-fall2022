# üìÜü§ñ asynchronous week!
## online-only assignments, week of oct. 24th

### **we will not meet in-person, in-class this week!**  
**there will be no one in-person @ NAC on oct. 24th!**

instead, we will be spending more time conversing online and taking our projects to the next level. the following assignments are due **before class** on Oct. 31, when we meet again in-person:

- [ ] reflection post
- [ ] debug post
- [ ] 2 responses
- [ ] update post
- [ ] Github response
- [ ] Prototype Plan #2

## reflection post (üëæ Discord)

In your project's channel on Discord, write a reflection post (~300 words) about your experience with your demo/user testing day. Your post should respond to the following questions:
- Taking a look at your notes from Oct. 17th, what are your key takeaways from showing your prototype to someone in class?
- How did your "user" surprise you?
- What is something that you had to explain, that you did not expect to explain?
- What are 2 new questions you now have about your project going forward?
- What is 1 thing that you are definitely going to incorporate into your next (and final!) prototype, based on your user testing experience?

## debug post (üëæ Discord)

In the `#debug` channel on Discord, write a post that shares a current issue you are working through **OR** shows a recent issue you resolved in your project. The post should follow this format:
- Intro: give us a few sentences of context for how this issue fits into your project. Remember your audience: we have been following your project, we know the aim and the general methodology, but you need to tell us what part of your project the code relates to.
- Code: using [code blocks](https://gist.github.com/matthewzring/9f7bbfd102003963f9be7dbcf7d40e51#code-blocks) **and** [syntax highlighting](https://gist.github.com/matthewzring/9f7bbfd102003963f9be7dbcf7d40e51#syntax-highlighting) based on your coding language, share ~10-25 lines of code, with comments strategically written to help explain the code and the issue to us.
- Describe how you solved this problem, **or** ask us the main questions you are currently wrestling with for debugging. If you have already solved this, tell us about your reasoning and show us the steps you took to realize a solution. Tell us the story! ü™≤

## response posts (üëæ Discord)

This asynchronous week is about online communication, comments/questions, and support. You will need to respond to **2 separate posts** by your classmates - this could be in their project channel, in response to a `#debug` post (help someone or learn from their code issue!), or if you have a separate question based on your knowledge and interest in their project, you could ask that as well.

## update post (üëæ Discord)

Each person also needs to create 1 update post based on progress on your prototype (same as a typical week).

## Github response (üê± Github)

I will be creating pull requests in order to start a comment chain with a few questions or comments per student branch on Github. Please respond to the comments and questions before the start of next class.  [Detailed instructions here!](https://github.com/mab253/designII-fall2022/blob/main/assignments/github-comments.md) *If Github is new to you, please ask questions about this assignment on Discord after you play around looking for comments.*

## work on Prototype Plan #2

Remember that your 2nd (and final!) Prototype Plan is due by the end of class on Monday Oct. 31. [You can see guidelines for this assignment here.](https://github.com/mab253/designII-fall2022/blob/main/assignments/proto-plan2.md) Prototype plans are part of your final project's grade.
