# ü§ñü¶é final assignment

Your final assignment for Senior Design has 2 stages: a demo day with a "lightning talk," and a final code package with a short paper and documentation.

**phase 1:** (demo and talk) due in-class (6:30pm) Monday, Dec. 12th 

**phase 2:** (paper and code) due Friday, Dec. 16th

## phase 1: due Dec. 12th

‚ö°Ô∏è lightning talk 
- Each project will give a 7 minute (max) presentation. This will be a talk with a different goal than your workshop presentations; you will be imagining an audience who has never seen your software. You will need to develop a visual aid that matches your short talk. We will discuss this in-depth in class on Dec. 5th. 

üíª functioning demo
- Your project's final prototype should be functional in order to share with classmates, with your inputs, outputs, and front-end design in their final format. We will share prototypes in pairs after the lightning talks.

## phase 2: due Dec. 16th

### üìÑ paper

Each project is required to turn in a paper with the following sections:
#### Abstract: 
This should be a 1 paragraph introduction and summary of your project. In a concise format, you should state the motivation behind your project (why does it exist? What world systems or "problems" does your software attempt to address? Who is this project for, who is your user?), the methods you used to build your software, and a conclusion stating your results and a quick reference to future extensions. 
#### Introduction:
Present some background information about your problem domain and the motivation for building your particular project. You are welcome to use (and refine) your proposal from last semester in this section, which is about providing context for your reader. This section should be at least 300 words. 
#### Methods
In this section, please break down the components that you utilize to make your program run. What algorithms, languages, and other tools have you used? Where does data flow through your app (from input, to processing, to database, etc.?) If you did any data work (training a model, writing a script to clean data from an API, etc.), please tell this "story" in the description of your process in this section. This section should be at least 500 words. 
#### System Diagram
Include a final version of your system diagram, showing how your components and modules work together. This may be hand-drawn but clean, or digitally created.
#### Reflection
What were the milestones that you went through when designing this project? What were major decision points and how did you decide? What were aspects of the project that majorly changed or that you had to cut, and why? How significantly different is your final project from the proposal from last semester, or from prototype plan #1 in this semester? This section should be at least 500 words.
#### Extensions
What are the limitations of your current prototype? If given more time and resources, what would you extend about this project? Would you enhance performance, add a feature, improve the front-end design, go through more rigorous rounds of user testing? (Hint: all projects could go through more rigorous rounds of user testing!). Most importantly, for each extension that you mention, **be sure to include a brief idea of how you would go about improving your project in the future.** 
#### Bibliography 
Your paper should cite at least 4 sources, whether citing where you found some code or process idea in the Methods section, citing some research you have done for context in the Introduction or Extensions sections. You may use whatever format for citations that you choose - [Chicago footnotes](https://www.scribbr.com/chicago-style/footnotes/) is a good one if you need an example.

### üìú documentation
Each project will need to write a README.md, which includes the following:
- overview: what does your software do? Who might want to use this?
- instructions for accessing your project, if it is hosted online; OR
- instructions for downloading and installing your project, if it is a local package
- brief overview of the directories and files in your project (what can we expect to find, where?)
- 1 screenshot of front-end design, what users should expect to see
- anything else that you want your user to know (instructions/commands? any extension ideas for developers?)
    
examples: https://github.com/matiassingers/awesome-readme 
We will discuss this in-depth in class on Nov. 28th.


### üìÄ code upload
Each project is required to upload code to Github, using the following instructions (TBD). [This will be very similar to the branching method we used for prototype #1] 

If your code is distributed (i.e. hosted on cloud platforms, multiple places) - please copy the code that you can into a Github branch and make the project structure explicit in your README.MD. Please ask me if you have any specific questions about formatting here.

If you have done extensive data cleaning work with a script that you have written, please also create a folder for this in your project and upload it. 

**A note on code comments:**
Inside your functional code, if you have used code that comes from another programmer or another project, you need to cite this explicitly. You can write a comment directly above where this code starts, and cite the source by including the project name, the programmer's name (if known), and a link to where you found this code. Include the date that you found it, if possible.

For example: 

```
/***********
  This code was adapted from:
  David Bowie
  https://github.com/davidjonesbowie
  Accessed: Oct. 2022
*************/
```
*You do not need to follow this format exactly, but your comment should cite the same information (name, link/source, and date if possible)*

In written language for a paper, we also cite when it's not a direct quote, but it is an *idea* that we learned from a specific source. If you have parts of your project that fit this description, please comment and cite here as well. 

Example:

```
/* The following method is inspired by work done by Proton the Cat, Jupyter notebook available @ https://github.com/proton-the-cat */
```

**This commenting and citation of code is NOT OPTIONAL.** If you do not cite code where you have copied either the exact lines or the inspiring method of someone else, this could be considered plagiarism in the context of this final project.
