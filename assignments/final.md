# ü§ñü¶é final assignment

Your final assignment for Senior Design has 2 stages: a demo day with a "lightning talk," and a final code package with a short paper and documentation.

**phase 1:** (demo and talk) due in-class (6:30pm) Monday, Dec. 12th 

**phase 2:** (paper and code) due Friday, Dec. 16th

## phase 1: due Dec. 12th

‚ö°Ô∏è lightning talk 
- Each project will give a 7 minute (max) presentation. This will be a talk with a different goal than your workshop presentations; you will be imagining an audience who has never seen your software. We will discuss this in-depth in class on Dec. 5th. 

üíª functioning demo
- Your project's final prototype should be functional in order to share with classmates, with your inputs, outputs, and front-end design in their final format. We will share prototypes in pairs after the lightning talks.

## phase 2: due Dec. 16th

- üìÑ paper
Each project is required to turn in a paper with the following sections:

    - ### Abstract
        - This should be a 200 word introduction and summary of your project.
    - ### Methods
        - In this section, please break down the components that you utilize to make your program run. What algorithms, languages, and other tools have you used? Where does data flow through your app (from input, to processing, to database, etc.?) If you did any data cleaning work that is not reflected in the final app, please include that in the description of your process in this section. This section should be at least 500 words. 
    - ### System Diagram
        - Include a final version of your system diagram, showing how your components and modules work together. This may be hand-drawn but clean, or digitally created.
    - ### Reflection
        - What were the milestones that you went through when designing this project? What were major decision points and how did you decide? What were aspects of the project that majorly changed or that you had to cut, and why? How significantly different is your final project from the proposal from last semester, or from prototype plan #1 in this semester? This section should be at least 500 words.
    - ### Extensions
        -
    - ### Bibliography 

- üìú documentation
Each project will need to write a README.md, which includes the following:

    - overview: what does your software do?
    - instructions for accessing your project, if it is hosted online; OR
    - instructions for downloading and installing your project, if it is a local package
    - 1 screenshot of front-end design, what users should expect to see
    
examples: https://github.com/matiassingers/awesome-readme 
We will discuss this in-depth in class on Nov. 28th.


- üìÄ code upload
Each project is required to upload code to Github, using the following instructions. [this will be very similar to the method we used for prototype #1] 

If your code is distributed (i.e. hosted on cloud platforms, multiple places) - please copy the code that you can into a Github branch and make the project structure explicit in your README.MD. Please ask me if you have any specific questions about formatting here.

If you have done extensive data cleaning work

**A note on code comments:**
Inside your functional code, if you have used code that comes from another programmer or another project, you need to cite this explicitly. You can write a comment directly above where this code starts, and cite the source by including the project name, the programmer's name (if known), and a link to where you found this code. Include the date that you found it, if possible.

For example:

```
/*This code was adapted from:
  David Bowie
  https://github.com/davidjonesbowie
  Accessed: Oct. 2022
*/
```

In written language, we also cite when it's not a direct quote, but it is an *idea* that we learned from a clear and specific source. If you have parts of your project that fit this description, please comment and cite here as well. 

Example:

```
/*The following method is inspired by work done by Proton the Cat, @ https://github.com/proton-the-cat*/
```

**This commenting and citation of code is NOT OPTIONAL.** If you do not cite code where you have copied either the exact lines or the inspiring method of someone else, this could be considered plagiarism in the context of this final project.
