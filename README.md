# CS59867 - Senior Design II

**Instructor:** Madeline Blount \
**Term:** Fall 2022 \
**Time:** Mondays 6:30pm-9:00pm \
**Office Hours:** Tues. by appointment, [schedule here](https://www.cal.com/mab253) \
**E-mail:** `mblount@ccny.cuny.edu` 

## course description

*In the second semester of this senior design course, we will focus on building individual software projects, the same ones we created proposals for last semester. Last semester we considered software as intervention, thinking throughout our design process about software‚Äôs potential impact in various other systems operating in the world. This semester, we will work on writing and making this software, going through an iterative and collaborative build process that includes phases of workshopping, collaborating, testing, and prototyping. We will continue to ask sociotechnical questions and interrogate the tools we use, the solutions we attempt, and the code we are writing. The final projects for this class may not be entirely ‚Äúin production‚Äù or ‚Äúfinished‚Äù (is software ever finished?) - but you will produce functioning prototypes, running on thoughtful and sophisticated code, showing visual design polish.* 

## what will we learn in this class?
- how to think critically about technology while we build it 
- how to take a project from a proposal phase to prototypes and production
- how to integrate user testing and colleague feedback into an iterative build process
- how to give and receive constructive criticism
- how to debug and "get unstuck" as programmers
- how to create a community for creating, critiquing, and supporting each other's work

## course format

This course will meet *in-person*. This course will focus significantly on crafting the environment and community for our weekly meetings - we will be creating a [studio](https://www.howiteachdesign.com/03_0_design_studio.php), a [hackerspace](https://wiki.hackerspaces.org/Hackerspaces), makerspace, lab, workshop, etc. We will work together to determine exactly what means for us as a group.

üé® Each 2.5 hour classtime will likely involve:

- **Check-In** 20 min.
  - also called "sync", we will give quick life and/or project updates
- **Workshop Presentations** 60 min.
  - we will all be participating in offering each other workshops!
  - on some weeks, 2 projects will give presentations (more details will be given on these assignments)
  - on other weeks, a demo or talk by the professor, topic to be determined by class/project needs 
- **Open Studio Time** 60 min.
  - unstructured work on projects; collaboration encouraged!
  - pair-programming may be assigned
  - 1:1 check-ins w/professor (optional), sign-ups determined each week
 - **Wrap-Up** 10 min.
  - we'll report back on the day, ask questions, go over any class logistics
  
 We will 

This class also assumes considerable self-directed time outside of class for working on your final Senior Design projects. This also involves contributing to the class Discord, Github, and other asynchronous projects as assigned throughout the course.

## materials and references

All course material will be linked via Blackboard and Github (here). There will be extra links and further references listed every week, beyond the required materials, that might be helpful to you. There will be no textbook for this course other than what's linked here. I will post the readings at least 2 weeks in advance, but if you look far ahead you might see some "TBDs." I will also post any lecture material (slides, links, etc.) in a folder in this repo called `/lectures`. Information and instructions for any assigments will be in a folder called `/assignments`.

## tools we will use a lot
- Github: please get a free account, [here](https://www.github.com)
- Glitch: please get a free account, [here](https://www.glitch.com)
- Zoom: we will always start class here
- Blackboard 
- Node.js, npm

We will use other software development kits (SDKs), APIs, tools, places to meet and collaborate online, etc. throughout the course. This will be noted in specific weeks. 

## expectations and requirements  

- class attendence and punctuality: please come prepared and on-time for every class. 
- participate actively in lecture with questions, and discussion - ["move up, move up"](https://www.nasco.coop/sites/default/files/srl/AORTA%20Meeting%20Facilitation%20Resource%20Sheet%20July%202014.pdf)
- if you know you are going to miss class, please e-mail me. Attending and participating in every class counts towards your final grade (see below). Lateness beyond 20 minutes is considered an absence.
- we'll be sharing and critiquing each others' work - try to be honest and friendly, open and respectful when giving/receiving feedback

This class is an inclusive and harassment-free space for everyone, with no tolerations of discimination based on gender, race, sexual orientation, religion, disability, or appearance. Please feel free to let me know privately if you require an academic accommodation.

## evaluation:
Grading breakdown:
- Participation/Attendance: 25%
- Weekly Assignments: 35%
- Final Project Proposal: 40%

weekly assignments: 
- weekly assignments must be turned in _before_ the next class: this means **5:00pm Monday EST** - unless specifically noted otherwise
- weekly assignments are more for participation than in-depth feedback
- your weekly assignments are to help you prepare for your final proposal
- any late assignments = drop 10% per day
- you get to drop your worst assignment grade if you need to

## academic honesty and integrity:

Plagiarism is "the act of presenting another person's ideas, research or writings as your own." [(CUNY)](https://www.ccny.cuny.edu/it/academic-integrity-policy). [see what I did there ...?] **In all seriousness:** *please be mindful and cite your references*, both when you are writing in sentences and writing in code: Stack Overflow is a great resource, but your code cannot be copied and pasted for your assignments. Your work for proposals and written assignments must include citations when you are referencing others' work. 

You can find CCNY‚Äôs Acedemic Integrity Policy in full [here](https://www.ccny.cuny.edu/it/academic-integrity-policy).  Do not plagiarize. 

## contact and questions

Please e-mail me - I am available for your questions! I try to respond within 24 hours. You are also invited to schedule some virtual office hour time to talk, [here](https://www.cal.com/mab253). If you need a time that's not on this schedule, please e-mail me.
