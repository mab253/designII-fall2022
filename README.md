# CS59867 - Senior Design II

**Instructor:** Madeline Blount \
**Term:** Fall 2022 \
**Time:** Mondays 6:30pm-9:00pm \
**Space:** NAC 4/157  
**Office Hours:** Tues. 3:00-5:00pm by appointment, [schedule here](https://www.cal.com/mab253) \
**E-mail:** `mblount@ccny.cuny.edu` 

## course description

*In the second semester of this senior design course, we will focus on building individual software projects based on our previously written proposals. Last semester we considered software as intervention, thinking throughout our design process about software‚Äôs potential impact in various other systems operating in the world. This semester, we will work on writing and making this software, going through an iterative and collaborative build process that includes phases of workshopping, collaborating, testing, and prototyping. We will continue to ask sociotechnical questions and interrogate the tools we use, the processes we go through, the solutions we attempt, and the code we are writing. The final projects for this class may not be entirely ‚Äúin production‚Äù or ‚Äúfinished‚Äù (is software ever finished?) - but you will produce functioning prototypes, running on thoughtful and commented code, incorporating your own visual design.* 

## what will we learn in this class?
- how to think critically about technology while we build it 
- how to take a project from a proposal phase to prototypes and production
- how to integrate user testing and colleague feedback into an iterative build process
- how to give and receive constructive criticism
- how to debug, problem solve, and "get unstuck" as programmers
- how to document and present your work, to fellow engineers and others
- how to create a community for building, critiquing, and supporting each other's work

## course format

This course will meet *in-person*. Our work will focus significantly on crafting the environment and community for our weekly meetings - we will be creating a [studio](https://www.howiteachdesign.com/03_0_design_studio.php), a [hackerspace](https://wiki.hackerspaces.org/Hackerspaces), makerspace, lab, workshop, etc. We will work together to determine exactly what means for us as a group.

üé® Each 2.5 hour class session will likely involve:

- **Check-In** 20 min.
  - also called "sync", we will give quick life and/or project updates
  - assign roles for the day: notetaker, timekeeper
- **Workshop Presentations** 60 min.
  - we will all be participating in offering each other workshops!
  - on some weeks, 2 projects will give presentations for crit (more details will be given on these assignments)
  - on other weeks, a demo or talk by the professor, topic to be determined by class/project needs 
- **Open Studio Time** 60 min.
  - unstructured work on projects; collaboration encouraged!
  - pair-programming may be assigned
  - 1:1 check-ins w/professor (optional), sign-ups determined each week
- **Wrap-Up** 10 min.
  - we'll report back on the day, ask questions, go over any class logistics
  
üëæ We will also build an asynchronous offline community (as exists in nearly every endeavor @ this point, Fall '22). We will have a class [Discord](https://discord.com/) server where we will have multiple channels for posting updates, posing questions, commenting on and helping with each other's work, sharing resources, etc.

**This course also assumes considerable self-directed time outside of class for working on your final Senior Design projects.** Our weekly meetings will be most helpful to you if you have new work, new issues, and new ideas to share!

## assignmnents

You will be responsible for:
  - weekly: [Discord log](https://github.com/mab253/designII-fall2022/blob/main/discord.md), due 5:00pm EST *before* every class session
  - 2 prototype plans (due Week 4 & Week 8)
  - 2 prototypes (due Week 6 and Final date)
  - 2 [workshop presentations](https://github.com/mab253/designII-fall2022/blob/main/presentations.md), 1 short pitch (in-class)
  - final: documentation, reflection paper, bibliography, code, and "artifact" (your software project itself)
  
 *More details for each of these assignments will be given throughout the semester.*  
 
 Your final work will be due **December 16, 2022 at 12:00pm EST.**

## materials and references

All course material will be linked via Blackboard, Discord, and Github (here). There will be extra links and further references listed every week, beyond the required materials, that might be helpful to you. There will be no textbook for this course other than what's linked here. I will post the readings at least 2 weeks in advance, but if you look far ahead you might see some "TBDs." I will also post any in-class workshop material (slides, links, etc.) in a folder in this repo called `/workshops`. Information and instructions for any assigments will be in a folder called `/assignments`.

Every student will also develop a project bibliography, in collaboration with the instructor. You will be able to choose readings that are meaningful and helpful to you, both in building and giving contextual framework for your projects. More details on this assignment will be provided during the course.

## tools we will use a lot
- Discord: please get a free account, [here](https://www.discord.com)
- Github: please get a free account, [here](https://www.github.com)
- Glitch: please get a free account, [here](https://www.glitch.com)
- Zoom: üò± we may need this, listing just in case
- Blackboard 

We will use other software development kits (SDKs), APIs, tools, places to meet and collaborate online, etc. throughout the course. This will be noted in specific weeks. 

## expectations and requirements  

The studio-style environment of this class means that attendance is very important, both for the growth of your own projects and for the learning of your fellow students. Design critiques and collaborative workshops simply will not happen if we don't have a consistently present, engaged crew of classmates. Attendance in-class, as well as engagement (active listening, asking questions, taking on roles like notetaker, generally following our community code), will count toward your final grade. 

That said, things happen. Everyone in this course will be allowed 1 absence, no questions asked. Every absence after this 1 will result in a deduction from your partipication/attendance portion of your final grade. Lateness beoynd 20 minutes is considered an absence.

*üîß What about Open Studio Time?*

Open Studio Time, while generally unstructured, is not optional. There is a kind of magic that can happen when you are working on individual projects, but together: we may find ourselves informally asking questions that someone else has some insight on, we may end up [pair-programming](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/12/10/the-friendship-that-made-google-huge) to fix a bug, we may get ideas from seeing someone else's sketch, or we may just appreciate the environment of being surrounded by others thinking. Even if this is not how you typically work, the experiment of this class involves working together in our own version of a hackerspace studio for approx. 1 hour each week. Some weeks, you may be helping others more than working on your own project - which may in fact foster your own ideas down the line. We'll be consistently checking in on what works and what doesn't for us - come with your sense of adventure!

TL;DR - no, you can't just bail on Open Studio Time because you prefer to work elsewhere. You will also need to work elsewhere! And your classmates needs you! Missing Open Studio Time counts as an absence.

If you know you are going to miss class, please e-mail me in advance and we will most likely be able to figure out make-up work for a pre-arranged absence.

This class is an inclusive and harassment-free space for everyone, with no tolerations of discrimination based on gender, race, sexual orientation, religion, disability, or appearance. Please feel free to let me know privately if you require an academic accommodation.

## academic honesty and integrity:

Plagiarism is "the act of presenting another person's ideas, research or writings as your own." [(CUNY)](https://www.ccny.cuny.edu/it/academic-integrity-policy). [see what I did there ...?] **In all seriousness:** *please be mindful and cite your references*, both when you are writing in sentences and writing in code: Stack Overflow is a great resource, but your code cannot be copied and pasted for your assignments. Your work for written assignments must include citations when you are referencing others' work. Any work that you submit during this class is presumed to be your own original work. Any omission of a citation will not be tolerated and can be considered academic dishonesty. **Do not plagiarize.**

From [Academic Integrity at MIT](https://integrity.mit.edu/handbook/writing-code), on code: *Writing code is similar to academic writing in that when you use or adapt code developed by someone else as part of your project, you must cite your source. However, instead of quoting or paraphrasing a source, you include an inline comment in the code. These comments not only ensure you are giving proper credit, but help with code understanding and debugging.*

You can find CCNY‚Äôs Academic Integrity Policy in full [here](https://www.ccny.cuny.edu/it/academic-integrity-policy). Failure to upload this Integrity Policy has serious consequences, including CS departmental involvement, an "F" on an assignment, or an "F" on the final grade in this course. 

## contact and questions

This semester, I will be an active member of our class Discord. You can always ask me a question there!

For private questions, please e-mail me - I am available! I try to respond within 24 hours. You are also invited to schedule some virtual office hour time to talk, [here](https://www.cal.com/mab253). If you need a time that's not on this schedule, please e-mail me.

## announcement from CCNY:

Students who find themselves experiencing difficulties obtaining food every day or who lack a stable and safe place to live are urged to come to Benny‚Äôs pantry for assistance (https://www.ccny.cuny.edu/bennysfoodpantry). Benny‚Äôs pantry is located on the ground floor of the North Academic Center (NAC) and is open to anyone within the CUNY community (students, staff, faculty) in need of support. The pantry is open from 10am to 6pm and is self-serve. Additional emergency support for financial, health and housing needs are also available through Benny‚Äôs. Please contact Dee Dee Mozeleski at dmozeleski@ccny.CUNY.edu or Charles Ramirez @cramirez@ccny.CUNY.edu for additional details.
